# Sorting-Algos
Classic sorts in C

### Notes
Might be fun to populate arrays with RNG ints, and then print out an ascii representation of the array after each successive iteration of an algorithm to give a visual representation of how the algo actually works. Pass in as a command line arg or just simply change some parameter in the code to enable this.
